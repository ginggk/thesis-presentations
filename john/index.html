        # What is this application?
        ***
        Base Camp Creature Champ is an interactive wave fighting game.
        * What do you mean by interactive?
            * That means that your decisions and accuracy determines how well you do.
        * What are waves?
            * In this application, waves are just simply the rounds you play, after you defeat an opponent, youâ€™ll move on to the next wave.
