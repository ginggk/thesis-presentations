# What Does This Application Do?
<i class="fas fa-ellipsis-h"></i> It generates a zip archive containing a customized portfolio that is based on form data.

<i class="fas fa-ellipsis-h"></i> The template is recreated from a online portfolio template (https://html5up.net/read-only) made from scratch. Also uses CSS flexbox.

<i class="fas fa-ellipsis-h"></i> The template uses variables with a web framework called Django to be able to insert the values into the custom portfolio.

<i class="fas fa-ellipsis-h"></i> This application also has a preview feature that allows users to view their website without downloading the zip archive.

# What did I learn?
<i class="fas fa-ellipsis-h"></i> I learned CSS Flexbox by doing a Wes Bos course on Flexbox. The link for that is: https://flexbox.io/

# What did I learn? Part 2!
<i class="fas fa-ellipsis-h"></i> I learned how to make a simple, dynamic and responsive website!

<i class="fas fa-ellipsis-h"></i> I copied a HTML5 Up Template that really challenged me on what I learned.

<i class="fas fa-ellipsis-h"></i> HTML5 Up Link: https://html5up.net/read-only

<i class="fas fa-ellipsis-h"></i> This was my result:
